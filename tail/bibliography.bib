For every sample, it was processed, sequenced and reported as soon as it was collected as other clinical samples for singleton pregnancies. The NIFTY test was negative in the 11 pregnancies carried normal fetuses, and was positive (high risk) in the case with discordant fetal Trisomy 21. The sensitivity and specificity were both 100{\%}. This small case series suggested the NIFTY as a screening test for fetal Trisomy 21 is feasible in twin pregnancies.},
