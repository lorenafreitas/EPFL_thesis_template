\section{Link between conventional PPI and the stationary PPI-CAP} 


Within the PPA/CAPs framework, it is well known that averaging the frames where the seed exceeds a ``well chosen'' threshold $\phi$, yields a proxy for the conventional seed connectivity map \citep{Tagliazucchi2012,Liu2013}.
This observation can be explained in the following way:
let us assume that the activity time course $S(t)$ of a seed voxel is a realization over time, $t=1,\ldots,N$, of a random variable $S$ for which $E[S]=0$ and $E[S^2]=1$. 
To construct conventional seed connectivity, a general linear model (GLM) is put forward to explain the time course $V(t)$ of a target voxel as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:ppa_glm}
  V(t) & =& \beta S(t) + \varepsilon(t),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta$ is the parameter weight (i.e., functional connectivity) and $\varepsilon(t)$ is the residual and assumed to be a realization of the noise with $E[\varepsilon]=0$ and  $E[\varepsilon^2]=\sigma^2$. In addition, we assume the noise to be independent from the seed voxel activity; i.e., $E[S\cdot \varepsilon]=0$. Multiplying both sides of Eq.~(\ref{eqn:ppa_glm}) with $S(t)$ and taking the expectation leads to:
\begin{eqnarray}
   E[ V  \cdot S ]  & = & \beta E[S^2] + E[S \cdot \varepsilon],
\end{eqnarray}
which simplifies into $\beta=E[V\cdot S]$. 

To obtain the stationary map in the CAPs approach, we want the expectation value of the target voxel for frames where the seed exceeds a threshold $\phi$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_\text{CAP+} &=& E[V:S>\phi] \\
          &=& E[\beta S + \varepsilon : S>\phi] \\
          &=& \beta E[S : S>\phi] + E[\varepsilon  : S>\phi],    \label{eqn:ppa-proof}
\end{eqnarray}
where in the first step we have substituted the previous GLM of Eq.~(\ref{eqn:ppa_glm}) and ``$:$" implies conditioning.
Due to the independence of noise and seed voxel, and $E[\varepsilon]=0$, the second term of Eq.~(\ref{eqn:ppa-proof}) will vanish, and we obtain
\begin{equation}
 I_\text{CAP+} = \beta E[S : S > \phi],
\end{equation}
which means that the expectation of suprathreshold frames in the PPA method will be proportional to the result of a conventional correlation map, with the constant of proportionality given by $E[S|S > \phi]$, which only depends on the seed, and not the target voxel. A similar relationship can be derived when the seed activity is below the negative threshold: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_\text{CAP-} &=& E[V : S<-\phi] \\
          &=& E[\beta S + \varepsilon : S<-\phi] \\
          &=& \beta E[S : S<-\phi] + E[\varepsilon  : S<-\phi] \\
          &=& \beta E[S : S<-\phi]
\end{eqnarray}
In the case of a two-sided threshold, using the identity $\sign(A)A = |A|$, we can conclude that: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_{CAP} &=& E\big[\sign(S)V : \left| S \right|>\phi\big] \\
   &=& E[\beta S\sign(S) + \varepsilon\sign(S) : \left| S \right|>\phi\big] \\
          &=& \beta E[S\sign(S)  : \left| S \right|>\phi\big] + E[\varepsilon \sign(S)  : \left| S \right|>\phi\big] \\
               &=& \beta E\big[|S|\, : \, \left|S \right| > \phi\big].
\end{eqnarray}



Based on this observation, we can generalize to PPI for which the GLM becomes:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:ppi_glm}
  V(t) & =& \beta_S S(t) + \beta_T T(t) + \beta_{PPI} P(t) + \varepsilon(t),
\end{eqnarray}
where $T(t)$ is the time course of the task and $P(t)$ is the ``interaction term'' given by $P(t) = S(t)T(t)$. The stationary map of the PPI-CAPs analysis then averages values of the target voxel multiplied with the sign of the interaction term, where the selection is based on the criterion of the seed exceeding the threshold: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
   I_\text{PPI-CAP} & = & E[ \sign(ST) V : \left| S\right|>\phi] \\
   & = & E[ \sign(ST) ( \beta_S S + \beta_T T + \beta_{PPI} P + \varepsilon) : \left| S\right| >\phi] \\
   & = & \beta_S E[ \sign(ST) S : \left| S \right|>\phi] + \beta_T E[\sign(ST) T : \left| S \right|>\phi] + \beta_{PPI} E[\sign(ST) P : \left| S \right| > \phi].
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the identities $\sign(A)A = |A|$ and $\sign(AB)A = \sign(B) |A|$, this becomes
\begin{eqnarray*}
  I_\text{PPI-CAP} &= & \beta_S E\big[\sign(T)|S| : \left| S\right|>\phi\big] + \beta_T E\big[\sign(S)|T| : \left| S\right|>\phi\big] \label{eqn:ppi-T-term} + \beta_{PPI} E\big[|ST| : \left| S\right|>\phi\big] \\
  & \approx & \beta_{PPI} E\big[|ST| : \left| S\right|>\phi\big].
\end{eqnarray*}
The last approximation can be made when the contributions of the first two terms are negligible. 
For the first term, we assume the absolute value of $S$ to be independent of the task (that weights the expectation operator) and $T$ has equal number of positive and negative values, in which case the first term will be 0. 
For the second term, if the task is just a change of sign, then its absolute value will be fixed and uncorrelated to the sign of the seed. Thus the second term is proportional to $E\big[\sign(S) : \left| S\right|>\phi\big]$, which is necessarily bound between $\pm1$ and will be exactly 0 if S is symmetric.

Therefore, what remains is the final term and we find that the result of a PPI analysis will be proportional to the SiMap.
This brief derivation also shows that the stationary PPI-CAP can be contaminated by ``leakage'' from the seed and/or task contributions if these assumptions are not fulfilled.

(Bottom) Visual inspection of the consensus matrices showed that the most stable values for $k$ (that is, those for which any two frames would most consistently be clustered together or separately) were $k=3$ and $k=4$.

\subsection{PCC-seed PPI-CAPs in preterm-born adolescents} \label{sm_pcc_ppicaps}
 In Chapter \ref{chapter:ch5}, Section \ref{section:ppicaps_preterm}, we perform a PPI-CAPs analysis to explore task-related dynamic connectivity using the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex as a seed. Here we provide a similar analysis using the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). While interpreting these additional results goes beyond the goal of this Section, this additional work illustrates that task-driven dynamics are a powerful and compelling strategy to uncover features of brain function in clinical populations independently of the choice of seed.
